# Volume-Control
Gesture recognition helps computers to understand human body language. This helps to build a more potent link between humans and machines, rather than just the basic text user interfaces or graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In this project for gesture recognition, the human bodyâ€™s motions are read by computer camera. The computer then makes use of this data as input to handle applications. The objective of this project is to develop an interface which will capture human hand gesture dynamically and will control the volume level.

## MediaPipe
Mediapipe is an open-source machine learning library of Google, which has some solutions for face recognition and gesture recognition, and provides encapsulation of python, js and other languages. MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution. It uses machine learning (ML) to infer 21 key 3D hand information from just one frame. We can use it to extract the coordinates of the key points of the hand.
